# LPLmaker

This will take roms and add them to a playlist for [RetroArch](https://www.retroarch.com) to use when they don't auto add because of CRC checking.

Note the generated playlist will be automatically rewritten by RetroArch in the current format.

This is a modified version of the Bash script created by [@jsbursik](https://github.com/jsbursik), which in turn was dervied from the script written by u/ShiftyAxel on reddit.
